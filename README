failsafe is a continual recording process. It creates mp4 files 1 hour in
length and saves them in the directory configured in the relevant config file
in the config directory. It was originally intended to also record MP3 files 
but given how easy it is to extract audio this seemed superfluous.

The primary reason for the failsafe is so that there is ALWAYS a recording,
even if no-one pressed the "start recording" button. Yes, it does happen.

DELETION of the files recorded via the failsafe program can be managed via a
simple cron job, e.g.

0 1 * * * find /mnt/RAID/VIDEO/FAILSAFE/*.mp4 -mtime +14 -delete 

This should be configured to delete at sensible intervals, those intervals
which should be determined via your available storage space.
