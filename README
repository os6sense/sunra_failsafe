Sunra failsafe is a continual recording process. It creates mp3 and mp4 files 
1 hour in length and saves them in the directory configured in the relevant
config file in the config directory.

The primary reason for the failsafe is so that there is ALWAYS a recording
of a group, even if no-one pressed the "start recording" button. Yes, it 
does happen.

There is a  daemon, sunra-failsafe.rb which are run at startup via the 
installed scripts.

Included with the failsafe programs is an archiver program which manages
the archiving and DELETION of the files recorded via the failsafe 
programs. This should be configured to archive and delete at sensible
intervals, those intervals which should be determined via your
available storage space.
